file info

All scripts should run with python version 2

adblock - first tier ad block lists
adblock.py - new algorithm
adblock.py.bak - old algorithm and backup of adblock.py
adblockresource.py - old algorithm and backup of adblock.py
adbserver.pid - mutex block cruft for server
block1.dat - second tier domain buckets
block2.dat - second tier general pattern lists
block2.py - abandoned python based filtering before transforming it to faster c code
blocklists.py - block1 and block2 generator.  blocklist.py will take the blocklist and generate those two files one for the faster domain pattern lookup and the other for slower pattern based lookup.
block.py - abandoned python based filtering before transforming it to faster c code
blocksrv.py - old abandoned script that held block list in memory without needing to regenerate every time. It was a database server that surfext.c sent queries to and intended to stay in memory for a long time to reduce overhead.
convert.py - currently active conversion script to convert the remote block lists into adblock.py
convert.py.bak - old conversion script and backup
customrules - custom rules for blocking
string_matching.py - contains string based matching alorithm like KMP and boyer-moore.
string_matching.pyc - precompiled version of string_matching.pyp
update.sh - adblock updater
whitelist - domains to ignore filtering

You can delete adblock.py.bak adblockresource.py convert.py.bak string_matching.pyc string_matching.py block.py block2.py.  They are archived for research.

surfext.c extension contains will process block1 and block2 for futher refined blocking.  It is currently disabled because the processing time takes too long, but it left there for someone to further improve it.  Currently WebKit2GTK is also lacking in lower level blocking via soup.
WebKit2GTK won't allow you low level access unlike WebKitGTK+ original
